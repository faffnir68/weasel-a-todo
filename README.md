# weasel-a-todo
Starting from a simple todolist and improve it as far as I can

## Why / Objectives
First time I touched React Application appears to be way too far before 2019 when they decided to simplify their system. 
I haven't touched it since, preferring focusing a bit on vueJS or Flutter. But as the company I am working for has decided to step into Shopify's world, I thought it would be a good idea to get back to it (Follow my thought, Hydrogen).

## Project
It will be first a simple todolist and I will improve it. Not so fancy...
